## What is "Menu"?
"Menu" is a pet-project, that let you to show my skills.
In this application I used next tools:
- Prototype JavaScript
- ES6
- AJAX
- Handlebars
- Webpack
- LESS

"Menu" has two realisations: 
- [Prototype](https://github.com/Muschina/Menu/tree/master/Prototype)
- [ES6](https://github.com/Muschina/Menu/tree/master/ECMAScript%206)

This application consist of side-menu, gallery and carousel. 

##How it works.
**Side-menu** renders from the template, after receipt of the AJAX GET-request. It has filter, that allows you to search items by title.

**Gallery** and **Carousel** renders after click on Side-menu items. They are filled by images of Side-menu items. If more than four images , the Carousel is possible to scroll the images. Otherwise Carousels arrows hidden.
